    <p>The White Stripes were an American rock duo formed in Detroit, Michigan, in 1997. The group consisted of Jack White (songwriter, vocals, guitar, piano, and mandolin) and Meg White (drums and vocals).</p>
    
    <p>Their successful and critically acclaimed albums White Blood Cells and Elephant drew attention from a large variety of media outlets in the United States and the United Kingdom. The single "Seven Nation Army", which used a guitar and an octave pedal to create the iconic opening riff,[1] became one of their most recognizable songs.</p>
